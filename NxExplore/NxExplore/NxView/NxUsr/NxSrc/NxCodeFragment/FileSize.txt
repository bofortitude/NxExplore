There is hurry.filesize that will take the size in bytes and make a nice string out if it.

>>> from hurry.filesize import size
>>> size(11000)
'10K'
>>> size(198283722)
'189M'
Or if you want 1K == 1000 (which is what most users assume):

>>> from hurry.filesize import size, si
>>> size(11000, system=si)
'11K'
>>> size(198283722, system=si)
'198M'
It has IEC support as well (but that wasn't documented):

>>> from hurry.filesize import size, iec
>>> size(11000, system=iec)
'10Ki'
>>> size(198283722, system=iec)
'189Mi'
Because it's written by the Awesome Martijn Faassen, the code is small, clear and extensible. Writing your own systems is dead easy.

Here is one:

mysystem = [
    (1024 ** 5, ' Megamanys'),
    (1024 ** 4, ' Lotses'),
    (1024 ** 3, ' Tons'),
    (1024 ** 2, ' Heaps'),
    (1024 ** 1, ' Bunches'),
    (1024 ** 0, ' Thingies'),
    ]
Used like so:

>>> from hurry.filesize import size
>>> size(11000, system=mysystem)
'10 Bunches'
>>> size(198283722, system=mysystem)
'189 Heaps'
